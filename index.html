    <h3>An Introduction About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Neha Vakkadala and I am a junior MIS major at TAMU! I love traveling and studied abroad in Madrid, Spain last semester,
      from where I visited 14 countries! My favorite color is pink and my current favorite song is No One Knows by Brent Faiyaz.</p>
    <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
    <p>A fun fact about me is that I am the only member of my family with curly hair!</p>

    <h3>Experiments with Generative AI </h3>
    <p>I asked Perplexity.AI to generate a small paragraph of content for my website regarding TAMU Football's 2025 season. 
      Here's what it gave me: The 2025 Texas A&M football season has showcased a remarkable start, 
      as the Aggies have surged to a 5-0 record and are currently ranked among the top five nationally in both the AP and 
      Coaches Polls. Under the leadership of head coach Mike Elko, now in his second year, Texas A&M has displayed resilience 
      and skill, highlighted by a thrilling 41-40 road victory against #8 Notre Dame, marking their first win over a ranked 
      opponent on the road since 2014. With dominant performances at Kyle Field and a roster featuring key contributors like 
      quarterback Marcel Reed, the Aggies look poised to compete for the SEC title and a potential College Football Playoff 
      berth as they approach a challenging slate of conference games in the second half of the season
